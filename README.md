## About 

A.B.C is an NLP project realised during my master's degree at [CentraleSup√©lec.](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/en/school-0)

The purpose of this project is to generate short biographies with few informations found on WikiData, using up-to-date models.

## Usage

The model has been uploaded [as a HuggingFace repository](https://huggingface.co/NicolasPeruchot/Biography) and the application is implemented with [Streamlit](https://share.streamlit.io/nicolasperuchot/biography/main/steamlit/stream.py).
